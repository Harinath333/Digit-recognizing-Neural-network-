ðŸ§  Digit Recognizer (Pure NumPy Neural Network)
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a digit recognition neural network using only NumPy, without any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

ðŸš€ Why this project?
This is my first step into the world of computer vision. Instead of using pre-built tools, I chose to build everything from scratch using NumPy to truly understand how neural networks work under the hood.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

Trained on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0â€“9)

Implements a multi-layer perceptron (fully connected neural network)

Uses custom activation functions, forward and backward propagation, and a simple training loop

No frameworks â€” just pure NumPy and logic

Designed as a base for future computer vision work

ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals
This project lays the foundation for my long-term vision of building AI systems in robotics and computer vision, including real-time handwritten text detection and recognition, object detection, and human-AI interaction systems.
